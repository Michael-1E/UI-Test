You are ecouraged to use ES6 'class'.

Starting from a list of 'points', where 'lat' and 'lng' are arbitrary latitudes and longitudes:

```
const points  = [
    [lat,lng], //e.g [45.123458,0.643523]
    [lat,lng],
    [lat,lng],
    [lat,lng],
    [lat,lng],
    [lat,lng],
    [lat,lng],
    [lat,lng]
]
```

With the Pin and Map classes provided, create a class that allows you to connect the pins on the map and the example code on how to invoke it.
